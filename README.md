## Development

Before you get started, ensure you have the following minimum versions: [Ruby 2.6+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/), [PostgreSQL 10+](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), [Redis 2.6+](https://redis.io/download).


# System Dependencies

* OS - Ubuntu 14.04/higher OR CentOS 6/7
* RVM
* Ruby 2.6.5
* Rails 5.2.3
* Git 2.16.3 or latest version
* DB- PostgreSQL 10.x or higher
* Redis - 2.6 or higher

# App Setup

Execute following rake:
* rake db:create RAILS_ENV=XXX
* pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -U yourdbusername -h localhost -d hermes latest.dump(For Dev ENV)


## .env file

  * WS=wss://localhost:3000
  * SNS_CONFIGURATION_SET=
  * SES_ADDRESS=
  * SES_USER_NAME=
  * SES_PASSWORD=
  * AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
  * AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
  * AWS_EMAIL_SERVER_ZONE=
  * AWS_SES_REGION='us-west-2'
  * AWS_S3_BUCKET=
  * AWS_S3_REGION=us-west-2
  * S3_BUCKET_CONVERSATION_PREFIX=emails
  * FULLCONTACT_TOKEN=
  * STRIPE_API_VERSION= 2020-03-02
  * STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
  * STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
  * STRIPE_SIGNING_SECRET1=
  * S3_INBOUND_EMAILS_BUCKET=
  * TRIAL_DAYS=1
  * support_email=xyz@domain.io
  * WHM_RESTRICTED_TOKEN=
  * WHM_HOST=upsend.io
  * WHM_USERNAME=upsend
  * SES_INBOUND_SMTP_ADDRESS=inbound-smtp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

1. WHM environment varialbes are used to add MX record for subdomain using cpanel API. The purpose is to make inbound emails work using SNS notifications. They are optional for local machine.
2. Db seed file will create a free plan for development purpose. But If you want to create all the stripe plans in local machine then configure stripe env variables with your account credentials and run rake stripe_plans:create && rake stripe_metered_plans:create

## Automated Testing Setup(Comming Soon)

## Production (Comming Soon)

## Built With

- [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) &mdash; Our back end API is a Rails app. It responds to requests RESTfully in JSON.
- [React.js](https://github.com/react/react.js) &mdash; Our front end is an React.js app that communicates with the Rails Graphql API.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) &mdash; Our main data store is in Postgres.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) &mdash; We use Redis as a cache and for transient data.

Plus *lots* of Ruby Gems, a complete list of which is at [/master/Gemfile](https://github.com/uniquesolution29/upsend-crm/blob/master/Gemfile).
